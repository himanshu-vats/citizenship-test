```

# Article Title Here

**Opening hook:** Start with a bold statement or question that grabs attention. This should make the reader feel like they NEED to read this article.

The first paragraph expands on the hook. It relates to the reader's pain points and promises value. Keep it conversational and direct using "you" language.

**Key Takeaway:** Use bold to highlight the most important sentence in each paragraph. This helps scanners get the main points quickly.

## First Main Section (H2)

Write 2-3 paragraphs here with natural **bold** for important terms and concepts. Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences max).

**Pro tip:** Bold the first phrase of important sentences to create visual hierarchy and make the article scannable.

Include relevant [links to official resources](https://www.uscis.gov) naturally in the text.

### Subsection (H3)

When you have multiple points, use lists:

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- **Mistake 1**: Explanation of what people do wrong
- **Mistake 2**: Another common error
- **Mistake 3**: Final mistake to avoid

Or numbered steps for processes:

1. **Step one title**: Detailed explanation with specifics
2. **Step two title**: More details here
3. **Step three title**: Final step

## Second Main Section (H2)

Continue with valuable content. Mix paragraphs with lists for variety.

**Important:** When you have critical information that readers absolutely must know, start the paragraph with bold text like this. It draws the eye immediately.

### When to Use What

Create comparison scenarios:

**If you filed N-400 before October 20, 2025:**
- You take the 2008 test (100 questions)
- Interview asks 10 questions
- Need 6 correct to pass

**If you filed N-400 after October 20, 2025:**
- You take the 2025 test (128 questions)
- Interview asks 20 questions
- Need 12 correct to pass

## Third Main Section (H2)

Keep the momentum going with more useful content.

**Quick reference:** You can create mini-sections with bold headers followed by explanatory text. This works great for FAQs or quick tips.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Most common question readers ask?**
Clear, direct answer here. Keep it concise but complete. Link to [relevant resources](/study) when helpful.

**Q: Second most common question?**
Another clear answer with actionable advice.

**Q: Third question?**
Final answer with next steps.

## Ready to Take Action?

Conclude with 2-3 paragraphs that:
- Summarize the key points
- Motivate the reader
- Give clear next steps

**Your next steps:**
1. [Take a practice test](/) to assess your current knowledge
2. [Study with flashcards](/study) to learn all questions
3. [Track your progress](/stats) to see improvement over time

**Remember:** The citizenship test is challenging but absolutely achievable with the right preparation. Thousands of people pass every month, and you can too.
