This guide will walk you through setting up Sanity CMS for your CivicsPass blog. Total setup time: ~5-10 minutes.

## Step 1: Create a Sanity Account & Project (3 minutes)

1. **Go to Sanity.io**: Visit https://www.sanity.io/
2. **Sign up**: Click "Get started" and sign up with:
   - GitHub (recommended - easiest)
   - Google
   - Or email
3. **Create a new project**:
   - Click "Create new project"
   - Project name: `CivicsPass Blog` (or any name you prefer)
   - Use schema: Choose "Clean project with no predefined schemas"
   - Dataset: `production` (default)
   - Click "Create project"

4. **Copy your Project ID**:
   - After creation, you'll see your Project ID (looks like: `abc123xy`)
   - Copy this ID - you'll need it in Step 3

## Step 2: Update Environment Variables (1 minute)

1. Open your `.env.local` file in the project root
2. Replace `your-project-id` with the Project ID you copied:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=abc123xy
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
   ```
3. Save the file

## Step 3: Deploy Your Sanity Studio (2 minutes)

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Wait for the server to start, then:

1. **Visit the Studio**: Open http://localhost:3000/studio in your browser
2. **Authorize the Studio**:
   - Click "Continue" to authorize your project
   - Sign in with the same account you used to create the Sanity project
   - Grant the Studio access to your project
3. **You're in!** You should now see the Sanity Studio interface

---

In the Sanity Studio (http://localhost:3000/studio):

1. Click **"Blog Post"** in the left sidebar
2. Click the **"+"** button to create a new post
3. Fill in the fields:
   - **Title**: "Welcome to CivicsPass Blog"
   - **Slug**: Click "Generate" (creates URL-friendly version)
   - **Excerpt**: "Learn about the US citizenship test and immigration process."
   - **Category**: Choose one (e.g., "Getting Started")
   - **Published Date**: Click to set today's date
   - **Read Time**: "3 min read"
   - **Meta Description**: "Welcome to the CivicsPass blog - your guide to the US citizenship test."

## How It Works

```
Your Blog Posts
    â†“ (stored in)
Sanity Cloud (Free Tier)
    â†“ (fetched by)
Next.js App (Vercel)
    â†“ (displayed at)
civicspass.com/blog
```

**Key Features:**
- âœ… Visual content editor (Sanity Studio)
- âœ… Rich text formatting (headings, lists, bold, links)
- âœ… Image uploads with cropping
- âœ… SEO-friendly (meta descriptions, slugs)
- âœ… Categories and filtering
- âœ… Real-time preview

## Deploying to Vercel

When you push to GitHub, Vercel will automatically:
1. Build your site with the Sanity integration
2. Fetch all published blog posts
3. Generate static pages for each post
4. Revalidate every 60 seconds for new content

**To add environment variables to Vercel:**
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Settings" â†’ "Environment Variables"
4. Add:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` = [your project ID]
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` = `production`
5. Redeploy your site

---

## Installing the Vercel + Sanity Integration (Optional but Recommended)

This enables advanced features like:
- **Edit Mode**: Click to edit content directly from your live site
- **Draft Mode**: Preview unpublished content
- **Vercel Toolbar Integration**: Visual editing indicators

**To install:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/integrations/sanity
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Select your Vercel project
4. Select your Sanity project
5. Authorize the connection

The integration will automatically:
- Sync environment variables
- Enable visual editing features
- Set up webhook deployments (auto-deploy when you publish content)

---

## Accessing the Studio After Deploy

**Local development:**
- http://localhost:3000/studio

**Production (after deploying to Vercel):**
- https://civicspass.com/studio

You can edit content from anywhere! Just visit `/studio` on your live site.

---

## Sanity Free Tier Limits

The free tier includes:
- **3 users** (admin seats)
- **100,000 API requests/month** (plenty for your traffic)
- **10GB bandwidth/month**
- **Unlimited documents** (blog posts)
- **5GB asset storage** (images)

For CivicsPass, this is more than sufficient. You'd need thousands of daily visitors to exceed these limits.

- Check console for errors
- Ensure Sanity packages are installed: `npm install`

### Blog posts not showing
- Verify you published the post (not just saved as draft)
- Check the blog page is fetching correctly
