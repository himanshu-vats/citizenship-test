## Tips

- **Draft Articles**: Save files locally without committing, or use Decap CMS "Draft" status
- **SEO**: Write compelling meta descriptions (150-160 characters)
- **Consistency**: Use the same category naming as existing posts
- **Internal Links**: Link to `/study`, `/`, `/settings` to keep users engaged
- **Publishing Schedule**: Commit future-dated articles; they'll show up based on the date field

## Troubleshooting

### Article not showing up?
- Check that the file is in `content/blog/` directory
- Verify frontmatter is valid YAML (proper indentation, quotes around strings)
- Check Vercel deployment logs for build errors

### Build failing?
- Ensure all required frontmatter fields are present
- Check markdown syntax (no unclosed brackets, proper formatting)
- Look at build logs on Vercel dashboard

### Can't access admin panel?
- Make sure Netlify Identity is set up correctly
- Check that `/admin` route is accessible
- Verify Git Gateway is enabled in Netlify Identity settings
