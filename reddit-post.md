## Post Body:

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Like many of you, I was preparing for the citizenship interview and found the civics test a bit overwhelming. I wanted something better than PDFs and paper flashcards, so I built [**CivicsPass.com**](https://civicspass.com) - a completely free study tool.

**What it does:**
- âœ… Interactive flashcards (Quizlet-style) for all questions
- âœ… Practice tests with instant feedback
- âœ… Both 2008 (100 questions) and 2025 (128 questions) versions
- âœ… Track your progress as you study
- âœ… Works on phone, tablet, or computer
- âœ… 100% free, no ads, no signup required

**Why I'm sharing:**
I passed my interview using this, and I thought it might help others in this community. The transition to the new 2025 test (starting October 20, 2025) can be confusing, so the app has both versions.

You can try it at [**civicspass.com**](https://civicspass.com) - would genuinely appreciate any feedback or suggestions to make it better!

Good luck to everyone on their citizenship journey! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
