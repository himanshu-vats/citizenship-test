        <Paragraph>
          <Strong>The harsh reality:</Strong> Over 30% of N-400 applications experience delays or requests for additional evidence (RFEs) due to preventable filing errors. One small mistake can add months to your naturalization journey and cost you additional filing fees.
        </Paragraph>
      </IntroBox>

      <Section id="introduction">
        <Paragraph>
          After reviewing thousands of N-400 applications and speaking with immigration attorneys, citizenship applicants, and USCIS officers, a clear pattern emerges: <Strong>most application problems are completely avoidable</Strong>.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          This guide walks through the seven most common N-400 filing mistakes that cause rejections, delays, and requests for evidence. More importantly, you'll learn exactly how to avoid each one.

      <Heading2 id="mistake-1">Mistake #1: Incorrect Personal Information</Heading2>

      <Heading3>The Problem</Heading3>
      <Paragraph>
        This seems obvious, yet it's the most common mistake on N-400 applications. Applicants provide information that doesn't match their Green Card, passport, Social Security records, or previous immigration documents.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph><Strong>Common discrepancies include:</Strong></Paragraph>
      <BulletList>
        <ListItem>Name spellings that differ from the Green Card (even by one letter)</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Birth dates formatted inconsistently across documents</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Previous addresses missing or listed in wrong order</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Maiden names or previous married names omitted</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Foreign address information incomplete or incorrectly formatted</ListItem>
      </BulletList>

      <WarningBox title="Real Case Example">
        <Paragraph>
          Maria's Green Card shows "Maria Elena Rodriguez-Garcia" but her passport shows "Maria E Rodriguez Garcia" (no hyphen). She filed her N-400 using the passport version. Result: RFE requesting clarification and proof that both names belong to the same person, adding 4 months to her timeline.
        </Paragraph>
      </WarningBox>

      <Heading3>How to Avoid It</Heading3>
      <NumberedList>
        <ListItem><Strong>Use your Green Card as the master reference.</Strong> Always match the exact spelling, punctuation, and formatting on your permanent resident card.</ListItem>
        <ListItem><Strong>Create a master document</Strong> listing every name variation you've ever used on legal documents. Include dates and reasons for changes.</ListItem>
        <ListItem><Strong>If you've legally changed your name,</Strong> include certified copies of marriage certificates, divorce decrees, or court orders with your application.</ListItem>
        <ListItem><Strong>Double-check your A-Number.</Strong> This 8-9 digit number must exactly match your Green Card. Write it separately and verify three times.</ListItem>
      </NumberedList>

      <TipBox title="Pro Tip">
        <Paragraph>
          Before filling out the N-400, create a photocopy of your Green Card and place it next to your computer. Reference it for every personal information field.

      <Heading2 id="mistake-2">Mistake #2: Incomplete or Inaccurate Travel History</Heading2>

      <Heading3>The Problem</Heading3>
      <Paragraph>
        Part 9 of the N-400 requires a complete list of all trips outside the United States during the statutory period (typically 5 years, or 3 years if married to a U.S. citizen). Many applicants:
      </Paragraph>

      <BulletList>
        <ListItem>Forget short trips across the Canadian or Mexican border</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Omit business trips they consider "routine"</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Can't remember exact dates from years ago</ListItem>
        <ListItem>List trips in the wrong format or miss required information</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Fail to explain trips that broke continuous residence</ListItem>
      </BulletList>

      <Paragraph>
        Here's what makes this tricky: <Strong>USCIS has your complete travel history</Strong>. Every time you enter or exit the U.S., Customs and Border Protection logs it. Your N-400 travel history will be compared against this government record.
      </Paragraph>

      <WarningBox title="Real Case Example">
        <Paragraph>
          James filed his N-400 and listed 8 trips abroad over 5 years. During his interview, the officer pulled up CBP records showing 23 trips. James had forgotten multiple weekend trips to visit family in Toronto and short business trips to Mexico. His case was continued pending submission of a corrected travel history with explanations for each omitted trip.
        </Paragraph>
      </WarningBox>

      <Heading3>How to Avoid It</Heading3>
      <NumberedList>
        <ListItem><Strong>Request your I-94 travel history</Strong> from CBP's official website (i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/history-search) before starting your N-400.</ListItem>
        <ListItem><Strong>Request your FOIA records</Strong> from USCIS and CBP. This takes 90+ days but provides your complete immigration file.</ListItem>
        <ListItem><Strong>Review old passports</Strong> (including expired ones) for entry/exit stamps.</ListItem>
        <ListItem><Strong>Check email and calendar</Strong> for travel confirmations, hotel bookings, and work schedules from the past 5 years.</ListItem>
        <ListItem><Strong>Count every single day.</Strong> If you left on March 15th and returned March 18th, that counts as a trip.</ListItem>
      </NumberedList>

      <TipBox title="Pro Tip">
        <Paragraph>
          Create a spreadsheet with columns for: Departure Date, Return Date, Total Days, Destination Country, and Purpose. Cross-reference against your I-94 records and passport stamps.
        </Paragraph>
      </TipBox>

      <Heading2 id="mistake-3">Mistake #3: Filing Too Early (Timing Errors)</Heading2>

      <Paragraph>
        Many applicants misunderstand when they become eligible to file. USCIS allows filing up to 90 days before meeting the continuous residence requirement, but calculating this correctly is where people make critical mistakes.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading2 id="conclusion">Conclusion: An Ounce of Prevention</Heading2>

      <Paragraph>
        The difference between a smooth N-400 process and a nightmare of RFEs, denials, and delays often comes down to attention to detail during the initial filing. The seven mistakes covered in this guide account for the vast majority of preventable problems.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Remember: <Strong>USCIS does not fix mistakes for you.</Strong> They either request additional evidence (delaying your case by months) or deny your application outright (losing your filing fee and starting over).
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Take your time. Use this guide. Double-check everything. And in a year or so, you'll be raising your right hand to take the Oath of Allegiance as a new United States citizenâ€”without the frustration of preventable delays.
      </Paragraph>

      <TipBox title="Final Pro Tip">
        <Paragraph>
          Consider having your completed N-400 reviewed by an immigration attorney or DOJ-accredited representative before filing. Many offer reasonably priced "N-400 review" services ($200-400). This small investment can catch mistakes before USCIS does and save you months of delays and frustration.
