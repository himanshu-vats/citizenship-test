      <Section id="introduction">
        <Paragraph>
          This comprehensive guide walks you through every step of the citizenship application process, from verifying your eligibility to taking the oath of allegiance. Whether you're just starting to consider citizenship or ready to file, you'll find everything you need to succeed.
        </Paragraph>
      </Section>

      <Heading2 id="step-1">Step 1: Verify Your Eligibility</Heading2>

      <Paragraph>
        Before spending <Strong>$760 on the N-400 filing fee</Strong>, confirm you meet all eligibility requirements. The most common pathway requires 5 years as a permanent resident, but there are several routes to citizenship.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading3 id="basic-requirements">Basic Requirements</Heading3>

      <Paragraph><Strong>Standard eligibility criteria include:</Strong></Paragraph>
      <BulletList>
        <ListItem>At least 18 years old</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Permanent resident (Green Card holder) for at least 5 years (or 3 years if married to U.S. citizen)</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Physically present in the U.S. for at least 30 months out of the past 5 years (or 18 months out of 3 years)</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Continuous residence in the United States</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Good moral character</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Basic understanding of U.S. history and government (civics test)</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Ability to read, write, and speak basic English</ListItem>
      </BulletList>

      <TipBox title="Pro Tip">
        <Paragraph>
          You can file your N-400 up to <Strong>90 days before</Strong> meeting the 5-year (or 3-year) requirement. This is called the "90-day early filing rule" and can significantly speed up your process.
        </Paragraph>
      </TipBox>

      <Heading3 id="continuous-residence">Continuous Residence Requirement</Heading3>

      <Paragraph>
        <Strong>Continuous residence</Strong> means you've maintained your home in the United States without extended absences. Trips outside the U.S. lasting 6 months or longer can break continuous residence.
      </Paragraph>

      <WarningBox title="Important">
        <Paragraph>
          Trips over 12 months <Strong>automatically break continuous residence</Strong> unless you obtained Form N-470 (Application to Preserve Residence) before departing. If you broke continuous residence, your 5-year clock restarts from your date of return.
        </Paragraph>
      </WarningBox>

      <Heading3 id="good-moral-character">Good Moral Character</Heading3>

      <Paragraph>
        USCIS evaluates your <Strong>moral character</Strong> during the 5-year (or 3-year) period before filing. Certain issues can prevent you from qualifying:
      </Paragraph>

      <BulletList>
        <ListItem>Criminal convictions (especially crimes of moral turpitude, aggravated felonies, or controlled substance violations)</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Failure to pay taxes or child support</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Lying on immigration applications</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Failing to register with Selective Service (if male, ages 18-26)</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Membership in terrorist or totalitarian organizations</ListItem>
      </BulletList>

      <TipBox title="Not Sure If You Qualify?">
        <Paragraph>
          Consult with an immigration attorney before filing. A consultation can save you hundreds in wasted fees.
        </Paragraph>
      </TipBox>

      <Heading2 id="step-2">Step 2: Prepare Your N-400 Application</Heading2>

      <Paragraph>
        The N-400 form is <Strong>21 pages long</Strong> and asks detailed questions about your background, residence, travel, employment, and moral character. Don't rush this stepâ€”errors can delay your case by months.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading3 id="gather-documents">Gather Required Documents</Heading3>

      <Paragraph><Strong>Essential documents you'll need:</Strong></Paragraph>

      <TipBox title="Organization Tip">
        <Paragraph>
          Create a spreadsheet with every address, employer, and trip abroad for the past 5 years <em>before</em> starting your N-400. This will save hours of frustration.
        </Paragraph>
      </TipBox>

      <Heading3 id="complete-form">Complete the Form Accurately</Heading3>

      <Paragraph><Strong>Critical sections that trip up applicants:</Strong></Paragraph>

      <WarningBox title="Warning">
        <Paragraph>

        <ListItem>$85 biometric services fee</ListItem>
      </BulletList>

      <TipBox title="Fee Waiver Available">
        <Paragraph>
          If your household income is at or below 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, you can request a fee waiver using Form I-912. Many applicants qualify and don't realize it.
        </Paragraph>
      </TipBox>

      <Heading2 id="step-4">Step 4: Attend Biometrics Appointment</Heading2>

      <Paragraph>

        </Paragraph>
      </TipBox>

      <Heading2 id="step-5">Step 5: The Citizenship Interview</Heading2>

      <Paragraph>
        This is the most important step. The interview typically occurs <Strong>8-14 months after filing</Strong> (but varies widely by location). You'll receive written notice 3-4 weeks before your interview date.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading3 id="civics-test">The Civics Test</Heading3>

      <Paragraph>
        You must correctly answer <Strong>6 out of 10 questions</Strong> about U.S. history and government. The officer selects 10 questions from the official list of 100 (2008 test) or 128 (2025 test).
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph><Strong>Which test version will you take?</Strong></Paragraph>
