# What Happens If You Fail the Citizenship Test?

Failing the citizenship test isn't the end of your journey—it's actually quite common, and you get another chance. **Understanding what happens next can reduce your stress** and help you prepare better for your second attempt.

Around 10% of applicants don't pass on their first try. If this happens to you, USCIS gives you **one more opportunity within 60-90 days** of your initial interview. This second chance is included in your original N-400 application fee—no additional payment required.

## What Actually Happens During the Interview

When you arrive for your citizenship interview, the USCIS officer will test you on two components: **civics (U.S. history and government) and English** (reading, writing, and speaking). You need to pass both to succeed.

**The civics test requirements:**
- 2008 test: Answer 6 out of 10 questions correctly
- 2025 test: Answer 12 out of 20 questions correctly
- Questions are randomly selected from the official list

**The English test has three parts:**
- Speaking: Demonstrated during your interview conversation
- Reading: Read 1 out of 3 sentences correctly
- Writing: Write 1 out of 3 sentences correctly

### If You Don't Pass

The officer will tell you immediately which component you failed. **You only need to retake the part you didn't pass**, not the entire test. For example, if you passed English but failed civics, you'll only retake the civics portion.

You'll receive a written notice (Form N-14) explaining:
- Which test component(s) you failed
- When you can schedule your second attempt
- What to expect during your retest

## Your Second Chance: The Retest

**USCIS schedules your retest within 60-90 days** of your first interview. You'll receive a notice in the mail with your appointment date and time. This retest is your final opportunity—if you don't pass the second time, your N-400 application is denied.

**Important facts about the retest:**
- No additional filing fee required
- Same format as the first test
- Only retake the component(s) you failed
- Different questions will be asked (randomly selected)
- Officer may be different from your first interview

### Preparing for Your Second Attempt

This is your time to focus and improve. **Most people who fail the first time pass on their second attempt** because they know exactly what to work on.

**Create a targeted study plan:**
1. **Identify weak areas**: Review which questions you missed
2. **Use official resources**: Study from [USCIS materials](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/find-study-materials-and-resources)
3. **Practice daily**: Spend 30 minutes each day reviewing
4. **Take practice tests**: Use [our practice test](/) to simulate the real experience
5. **Study with flashcards**: Master all questions using [our study mode](/study)

## What If You Fail the Second Test?

If you don't pass your retest, **USCIS will deny your N-400 application**. However, this doesn't mean you can never become a U.S. citizen—you can reapply.

**Your options after a denial:**
- Wait and reapply: File a new N-400 application (with new fees)
- Request a hearing: Appeal the decision within 30 days
- Improve your skills: Take English or civics classes before reapplying

**The new application process:**
- Complete a fresh N-400 form
- Pay the full filing fee again ($760 as of 2025)
- Start the process from the beginning
- Previous test history doesn't carry over

### How to Avoid This Situation

The best strategy is **thorough preparation before your first interview**. Most people who fail weren't adequately prepared or underestimated the difficulty.

**Success strategies:**
- Start studying at least 3 months before your interview
- Take multiple practice tests to gauge readiness
- Practice English reading and writing if it's not your first language
- Review all 100 (2008 test) or 128 (2025 test) questions
- Don't rely on memorization—understand the concepts

## Can You Reschedule Your Retest?

Yes, but **do it carefully**. If you need to reschedule your retest appointment, you must notify USCIS in writing as soon as possible. However, multiple reschedules may raise red flags.

Valid reasons for rescheduling include:
- Medical emergency (provide documentation)
- Work conflict that can't be avoided
- Previously scheduled travel
- Family emergency

**How to reschedule:**
1. Contact USCIS immediately
2. Explain your situation in writing
3. Provide supporting documentation
4. Request a new appointment date
5. Wait for confirmation before missing your scheduled appointment

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I appeal if I fail both tests?**
No, there's no formal appeal process for test failures. However, you can request a hearing if you believe there was an error in how your test was administered or evaluated. In most cases, your best option is to study harder and retake the test.

**Q: How much time do I have between the first and second test?**
USCIS typically schedules your retest between 60-90 days after your first interview. You'll receive written notice with your specific appointment date. This gives you 2-3 months to prepare.

**Q: Will the same officer conduct my retest?**
Not necessarily. You may have a different USCIS officer for your second interview. The questions will also be different—they're randomly selected from the official question pool each time.

**Q: Can I take citizenship classes between tests?**
Absolutely! Many communities offer free citizenship preparation classes. Check your local library, community college, or immigrant services organizations. Online resources like [our study tools](/study) can also help you prepare effectively.

**Q: What happens to my green card if I'm denied citizenship?**
Your permanent resident status (green card) remains valid even if your citizenship application is denied. You can continue living and working in the United States as a permanent resident and reapply for citizenship when you're ready.

Failing the citizenship test is disappointing, but it's not the end of the road. **With focused preparation and the right resources, most applicants pass on their second attempt**. The key is understanding what went wrong and addressing those specific weaknesses.
