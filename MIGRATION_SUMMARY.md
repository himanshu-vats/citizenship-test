## Why This Migration is Better

### Problems with Decap CMS + Netlify
1. **Two hosting platforms**: Vercel for app, Netlify just for OAuth (overcomplicated)
2. **No Vercel integration**: Couldn't use Edit Mode, Draft Mode, or Vercel Toolbar
3. **Limited features**: Basic markdown editor, no visual editing
4. **Extra complexity**: Needed GitHub OAuth app setup, Netlify deployment just for auth
5. **Not officially supported**: Decap CMS is designed for Netlify, not Vercel

### Benefits of Sanity CMS
1. **Native Vercel integration**: Official Vercel marketplace integration available
2. **Visual editing**: Rich WYSIWYG editor with real-time preview
3. **Edit Mode**: Click to edit content directly from your live site (with Vercel integration)
4. **Draft Mode**: Preview unpublished content before publishing
5. **Better media handling**: Built-in image optimization, cropping, CDN
6. **Powerful queries**: GROQ query language for flexible content fetching
7. **Scalable**: Cloud-hosted, handles images and content without Git
8. **Free tier**: 100k API requests/month, 10GB bandwidth, 5GB storage
9. **No extra services**: No need for Netlify at all
10. **Professional CMS**: Used by major companies, actively maintained

## How to Migrate Existing Content (If Needed)

If you had blog posts in Decap CMS that you want to migrate:

1. **Manual migration** (recommended for few posts):
   - Open old markdown files from `/content/blog/`
   - Copy content
   - Create new posts in Sanity Studio
   - Paste content (Sanity will convert markdown to rich text)

2. **Programmatic migration** (for many posts):
   - Write a Node.js script to read markdown files
   - Use Sanity's client to create documents
   - Contact me if you need help with this

## Accessing the CMS

**Local development:**
- http://localhost:3000/studio

**Production (after deploy):**
- https://civicspass.com/studio

**Blog pages:**
- https://civicspass.com/blog (listing)
- https://civicspass.com/blog/post-slug (individual posts)

---

## Environment Variables

### Local (`.env.local`)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
GOOGLE_CIVIC_API_KEY=AIzaSyC0qH66RAB5scLDl3_y8EkzddwaZzpzyfI
```

### Vercel Dashboard
Add the same Sanity variables to Vercel:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`
3. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`
4. Redeploy

---

## Cost Comparison

### Old Setup (Decap + Netlify)
- Netlify: Free tier (only for OAuth)
- GitHub OAuth: Free
- Storage: Git repo (limited)
- **Complexity**: Medium (two platforms)

### New Setup (Sanity)
- Sanity: Free tier (100k requests/month, 10GB bandwidth, 5GB storage)
- **Complexity**: Low (single platform)
- **Features**: Professional CMS with visual editing

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "Dataset not found"
- You haven't set up Sanity yet
- Follow `SANITY_SETUP.md` to create project and set environment variables
- Build will work fine until you configure Sanity (pages just show "No posts yet")

### Studio not loading at /studio
- Check that environment variables are set correctly
- Clear browser cache or use incognito
- Verify Sanity packages are installed: `npm install`

### Blog posts not showing
- Make sure you clicked "Publish" in Studio (not just save)
- Wait 60 seconds for revalidation
- Check browser console for errors
