# Complete N-400 Process Guide: Your Path to U.S. Citizenship

Becoming a U.S. citizen is one of the most significant milestones in your life, and the N-400 naturalization process is your gateway to achieving this dream. **Understanding each step of the journey helps you prepare properly and avoid costly delays**. This comprehensive guide walks you through every stage from eligibility check to oath ceremony.

The entire N-400 process typically takes **8-14 months from filing to citizenship**, though times vary significantly by location. Some applicants complete the process in as little as 6 months, while others may wait up to 24 months depending on their local USCIS office workload.

## Step 1: Verify Your Eligibility

Before spending $760 on the N-400 filing fee, **confirm you meet all eligibility requirements**. The most common pathway requires you to have been a permanent resident (green card holder) for at least 5 years, or 3 years if married to a U.S. citizen.

**Basic eligibility requirements:**
- At least 18 years old
- Permanent resident for required time period (5 years or 3 years)
- Physically present in the U.S. for at least half the required time
- Continuous residence without trips over 6 months
- Good moral character
- Basic English language skills (reading, writing, speaking)
- Knowledge of U.S. history and government

**Calculate your eligibility date carefully.** You can file your N-400 up to 90 days before reaching your 5-year or 3-year anniversary as a permanent resident. Filing even one day too early results in automatic denial and loss of your filing fee.

### Special Eligibility Situations

Some applicants qualify through different pathways:
- **Military service:** Active duty members and veterans may qualify with reduced or waived requirements
- **Spouse of U.S. citizen abroad:** Special rules apply if your spouse works overseas for certain organizations
- **Age 50+ with 20 years residence:** May qualify for English test exemption
- **Age 55+ with 15 years residence:** May qualify for English test exemption

**Critical warning:** Any criminal history, tax issues, or immigration violations can affect your eligibility. Consult an [immigration attorney](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship) if you have concerns about your record before filing.

## Step 2: Gather Required Documents

**Proper documentation prevents delays and requests for evidence.** Start collecting these documents at least 2-3 months before you plan to file. Missing or incomplete documentation is the number one cause of processing delays.

**Essential documents for everyone:**
- Copy of green card (front and back)
- Copies of all passports used during permanent residency
- Complete tax return transcripts for past 5 years (or 3 years)
- List of all trips outside the U.S. with exact dates
- Two passport-style photos (2x2 inches)

**Additional documents based on your situation:**

**If married:**
- Current marriage certificate
- Spouse's birth certificate or naturalization certificate
- Divorce decrees from all previous marriages (yours and spouse's)
- Proof of spouse's U.S. citizenship (if applicable)

**If you have children:**
- Birth certificates for all children
- Adoption papers (if applicable)
- Custody documents (if applicable)

**If you've had legal issues:**
- Court records and dispositions for any arrests or citations
- Proof of completed probation or paid fines
- Rehabilitation documentation

**Pro tip:** USCIS accepts tax return transcripts, not copies of your returns. Request these free from the IRS at [www.irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov) at least 6 weeks before filing—they take time to arrive by mail.

## Step 3: Complete Form N-400

The N-400 application is **21 pages with over 300 questions** about your background, residence, employment, travel, and moral character. **Every answer must be truthful and accurate**—lying on your application is grounds for denial and potential deportation.

**How to complete the form:**

**Option 1: Online filing (recommended)**
- Create USCIS online account at [my.uscis.gov](https://my.uscis.gov)
- Faster processing (typically 1-2 months sooner than paper)
- Automatic case status updates
- Easy document upload
- Lower risk of errors
- Can save progress and return later

**Option 2: Paper filing**
- Download current form from [USCIS.gov](https://www.uscis.gov)
- Use black ink only, print clearly
- Sign and date each required section
- Make complete copies before mailing
- Send via certified mail with return receipt

### Common N-400 Mistakes to Avoid

**These errors cause the most delays:**
- Failing to list all travel outside the U.S., including trips to Canada/Mexico
- Not disclosing minor traffic violations or arrests
- Inconsistent name usage across forms and documents
- Mathematical errors in calculating physical presence
- Missing signatures or dates
- Using an outdated version of the form
- Forgetting to include filing fee payment

**Critical section: Part 12 (Additional Information).** This is where you explain any Yes answers about criminal history, tax issues, or immigration violations. **Be honest and thorough**—USCIS will discover undisclosed issues during background checks.

## Step 4: Pay Filing Fees and Submit

As of 2025, the total cost is **$760** ($640 application fee plus $120 biometric services fee). Some applicants qualify for reduced fees or waivers based on income.

**Payment options:**
- Credit/debit card (online filing only)
- Check or money order payable to "U.S. Department of Homeland Security"
- Fee waiver (Form I-912) if your household income is below 150% of Federal Poverty Guidelines

**Where to submit:**

**Online:** Upload through your USCIS online account after completing the form

**Paper:** Mail to the address specified in the N-400 instructions (address varies by state)

**After filing, you'll receive:**
1. Receipt notice (Form I-797C) within 2-4 weeks with your case number
2. Biometrics appointment notice within 4-8 weeks
3. Interview notice within 6-12 months

**Save your case number!** You'll use this to check status updates at [egov.uscis.gov/casestatus](https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus).

## Step 5: Attend Biometrics Appointment

USCIS schedules your biometrics appointment at an Application Support Center (ASC) near you. **This appointment is mandatory**—you cannot skip it without requesting a reschedule in advance.

**What happens at biometrics:**
- Fingerprints taken (all 10 fingers)
- Digital photograph
- Signature captured
- Identity verification
- Takes only 15-30 minutes total

**Important rules:**
- Arrive 15 minutes early
- Bring appointment notice and green card
- No phones or bags allowed inside most facilities
- Children cannot accompany you into the appointment room

**If you need to reschedule:** Contact USCIS immediately at 1-800-375-5283. Valid reasons include medical emergencies, previously scheduled travel, or work conflicts. Multiple reschedules may delay your case significantly.

After biometrics, USCIS conducts FBI background checks using your fingerprints. **This process typically takes 3-5 months** and screens for criminal history, immigration violations, and national security concerns.

## Step 6: Prepare for the Civics and English Tests

While waiting for your interview notice, **spend 3-6 months preparing for the tests**. The civics test covers U.S. history and government, while the English test assesses reading, writing, and speaking abilities.

**Which test version you'll take depends on your N-400 filing date:**

**Filed before October 20, 2025:** 2008 test version
- 100 possible civics questions
- USCIS asks 10 questions at interview
- Must answer 6 correctly to pass (60%)

**Filed on/after October 20, 2025:** 2025 test version
- 128 possible civics questions
- USCIS asks 20 questions at interview
- Must answer 12 correctly to pass (60%)

**English test components:**
- **Speaking:** Demonstrated during interview conversation with officer

2. [Take practice tests](/) regularly to identify weak areas
3. [Use flashcards](/study) to memorize questions and answers
4. Practice English reading and writing daily

- Age 65+ with 20 years as permanent resident: Simplified civics test (20 designated questions)
- Medical disability: Form N-648 waives civics and/or English requirements

## Step 7: Attend Your Citizenship Interview

Your interview notice arrives **8-14 months after filing**, scheduling your appointment at your local USCIS office. **This is the most important day of your process**—arrive prepared and on time.

**What to bring to your interview:**
- Interview appointment notice
- Green card (original)
- State ID or driver's license
- Valid passport from your country
- All documents submitted with N-400

**Part 2: N-400 Application Review (10-15 minutes)**
- Officer reviews each section of your N-400

### Interview Tips for Success

**Do:**
- Dress professionally (business casual minimum)
- Arrive 15-30 minutes early
- Speak clearly and honestly
- Ask for clarification if you don't understand a question
- Bring an interpreter if you qualify for language exemption
- Be polite and respectful

**Don't:**

- Use your phone in the waiting area
- Volunteer information beyond what's asked
- Argue with the officer
- Lie or guess if you don't know an answer

## Step 8: Receive Your Decision

At the end of your interview, the officer provides **one of three decisions:**

**Option 1: Approved (N-652 form)**
- You passed all requirements
- Receive oath ceremony notice same day or by mail within 2-4 weeks

**Option 2: Continued (N-14 form)**
- Failed civics or English test

- Only retake the section you failed
- No additional fee required

**Option 3: Denied**
- Failed to meet eligibility requirements
- Serious issues with application or background
- Can appeal within 30 days or reapply later

**If you fail the first test, use your second chance wisely.** Most applicants who fail initially pass on their second attempt because they know exactly what to study. [Focus your preparation](/study) on the areas where you struggled.

## Step 9: Take the Oath of Allegiance

The oath ceremony is **the final step in becoming a U.S. citizen**. USCIS schedules these ceremonies regularly—you may take the oath the same day as your interview or within a few weeks.

**What happens at the oath ceremony:**

**Before the ceremony:**
- Check in and turn in your green card permanently
- Verify your Certificate of Naturalization information for accuracy
- Correct any errors before the ceremony begins

**During the ceremony:**

- Pledge loyalty to the United States
- Renounce allegiance to your former country

**After the ceremony:**
- Receive your Certificate of Naturalization
- Officially become a U.S. citizen
- Can register to vote immediately
- Can apply for U.S. passport

**The Oath of Allegiance:**

"I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same..."

**Your first priorities as a new citizen:**
