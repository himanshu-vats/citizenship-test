# ðŸš€ Vercel Deployment Instructions

## Quick Deployment (5 Minutes)

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Easiest - Recommended)

1. **Go to Vercel**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com
   - Click "Sign Up" (use GitHub login for easiest setup)

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "Add New..." â†’ "Project"
   - You'll see options to import from Git

3. **Choose Your Deployment Method:**

   **Option A: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)**
   - If your code is on GitHub:
     1. Click "Import Git Repository"
     2. Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub
     3. Select your `citizenship-test` repository
     4. Click "Import"

   **Option B: Deploy without Git**
   - If code is only local:
     1. Install Vercel CLI (see Method 2 below)
     2. Use CLI to deploy

4. **Configure Project** (Vercel auto-detects Next.js settings)
   - Framework Preset: **Next.js** (auto-detected)
   - Root Directory: `./` (leave as is)
   - Build Command: `npm run build` (auto-filled)
   - Output Directory: `.next` (auto-filled)
   - Install Command: `npm install` (auto-filled)

   **Environment Variables:** (Leave empty for now - none required)

5. **Deploy!**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for build
   - You'll get a URL like: `citizenship-test-abc123.vercel.app`

6. **Test Your Live App**
   - Click the generated URL
   - Test on your phone and computer
   - Share with friends!

### Method 2: Vercel CLI (For Developers)

If you prefer command line:

```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# 2. Login to Vercel
vercel login
# Opens browser to authenticate

# 3. Deploy from project directory
cd /workspaces/citizenship-test
vercel

# Follow prompts:
# ? Set up and deploy? [Y/n] y
# ? Which scope? (select your account)
# ? Link to existing project? [y/N] n
# ? What's your project's name? citizenship-test
# ? In which directory is your code located? ./
# ? Want to override the settings? [y/N] n

# Vercel will:
# - Build your app
# - Deploy to production
# - Give you URLs

# 4. Your app is live!
# Production: https://citizenship-test.vercel.app
# Deployment URL: https://citizenship-test-abc123.vercel.app
```

---

## After First Deployment

### Your URLs:

You'll get **two types of URLs**:

1. **Production URL** (main URL):
   - Format: `https://citizenship-test.vercel.app`
   - This is your permanent URL
   - Auto-updates when you push to main branch

2. **Preview URLs** (for each deployment):
   - Format: `https://citizenship-test-abc123.vercel.app`
   - Unique for each deployment
   - Good for testing before going live

---

## Setting Up Auto-Deployment (Optional but Recommended)

If you deployed via GitHub:

**Every time you push code to GitHub, Vercel auto-deploys!**

```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Update homepage design"
git push origin main

# Vercel automatically:
# 1. Detects the push
# 2. Builds your app
# 3. Deploys to production
# 4. Sends you an email with deployment URL
```

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### âœ… Test Your Live App:

1. **Desktop Testing:**
   - [ ] Visit your Vercel URL
   - [ ] Test version selection (2008 vs 2025)
   - [ ] Take a full practice test
   - [ ] Check study mode (flashcards)
   - [ ] View stats page
   - [ ] Toggle dark mode
   - [ ] Check settings page

2. **Mobile Testing:**
   - [ ] Open URL on iPhone/Android
   - [ ] Test portrait and landscape modes
   - [ ] Verify touch interactions work
   - [ ] Check dark mode toggle
   - [ ] Test navigation (bottom nav bar)
   - [ ] Try "Add to Home Screen" (Safari â†’ Share â†’ Add to Home Screen)

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Vercel?

**Check Build Logs:**
- In Vercel dashboard â†’ Your project â†’ Deployments
- Click failed deployment â†’ View Logs
- Look for error messages

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Module not found" errors:**
   ```bash
   # Make sure all dependencies are in package.json
   npm install
   git add package.json package-lock.json
   git commit -m "Update dependencies"
   git push
   ```

2. **Environment variables missing:**
   - For now, you don't need any
   - Google Civic API key is optional (app works without it)

3. **Build timeout:**
   - Vercel free tier has 45-minute build limit
   - Your app builds in ~30 seconds, so this shouldn't happen

---

## Adding a Custom Domain (Later)

Once you're ready to use a custom domain:

1. **Buy a domain** (Namecheap, Google Domains, Cloudflare)
   - Suggested: `uscitizenship.app` (~$12/year)

2. **Add to Vercel:**
   - Project Settings â†’ Domains
   - Add your domain
   - Follow DNS instructions

3. **SSL Certificate:**
   - Vercel auto-generates free SSL
   - Your site will be HTTPS automatically

---

## Vercel Free Tier Limits

Your app fits comfortably in Vercel's free tier:

- âœ… **Bandwidth:** 100 GB/month (enough for ~100,000 page views)
- âœ… **Build time:** 100 hours/month (you use ~5 minutes per build)
- âœ… **Deployments:** Unlimited
- âœ… **Functions:** 100 GB-hours/month (your API route is tiny)
- âœ… **Serverless Functions:** 100 hours/month

**You won't hit these limits unless you get 50,000+ users/month.**
