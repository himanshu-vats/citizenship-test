# 🚀 Deploy from Vercel Dashboard - Step by Step

Your code is now on GitHub! Follow these exact steps to deploy.

---

## Step 1: Go to Vercel

Open in your browser:
```
https://vercel.com
```

---

## Step 2: Sign Up / Log In

1. Click **"Sign Up"** (top right)
2. Choose **"Continue with GitHub"** (easiest)
3. Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub account

---

## Step 3: Import Your Repository

1. You'll see the Vercel dashboard
2. Click **"Add New..."** button (top right)
3. Select **"Project"** from dropdown
4. You'll see "Import Git Repository" section

---

## Step 4: Find Your Repository

1. Under "Import Git Repository" you'll see a list of your repos
2. Look for: **`himanshu-vats/citizenship-test`**
3. Click **"Import"** button next to it

*(If you don't see it, click "Adjust GitHub App Permissions" and grant access)*

---

## Step 5: Configure Project (Auto-Detected)

Vercel will auto-detect your Next.js app. You'll see:

**Framework Preset:** Next.js ✅ (auto-detected)

**Root Directory:** `./` (leave as is)

**Build & Development Settings:**
- Build Command: `npm run build` ✅ (auto-filled)
- Output Directory: `.next` ✅ (auto-filled)
- Install Command: `npm install` ✅ (auto-filled)

**Environment Variables:**
- Click "Add" if you want to add your Google Civic API key (optional)
- Name: `GOOGLE_CIVIC_API_KEY`
- Value: (paste your key from `.env.local`)
- Leave blank if you don't have it - app works fine without it!

---

## Step 6: Deploy!

1. Click the big **"Deploy"** button
2. Vercel will:
   - Clone your GitHub repo
   - Install dependencies (`npm install`)
   - Build your app (`npm run build`)
   - Deploy to production
3. Watch the build logs in real-time (cool animations!)

**Build time:** ~2-3 minutes

## Auto-Deployment is Enabled! 🎯

**Every time you push to GitHub, Vercel auto-deploys!**

Try it:
```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# Test" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Test auto-deploy"
git push origin main

# Check Vercel dashboard → You'll see a new deployment!
```

Vercel will:
1. Detect the GitHub push
2. Build your app

**No manual redeployment needed!**

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failed?

**Check the Logs:**
1. Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
2. Click the failed deployment
3. Click "View Function Logs" or "Build Logs"
4. Look for the error message

**Common Fixes:**
- Error says "Module not found" → Dependencies missing
  - Solution: Run `npm install` locally, commit `package.json`
- Build timeout → Usually not an issue for this app
- Environment variable missing → Add it in Settings

### Can't See Your Repo in Vercel?

1. Click "Adjust GitHub App Permissions"
2. Grant Vercel access to your repositories
3. Select "All repositories" or specific repo
4. Refresh the page

### Site Deployed but Shows Error?

- Check the Runtime Logs in Vercel dashboard
- Most common: Environment variable not set
