# What Happens If You Fail the Citizenship Test?

Failing the citizenship test isn't the end of your journey—it's actually quite common, and you get another chance. **Understanding what happens next can reduce your stress** and help you prepare better for your second attempt.

Around 10% of applicants don't pass on their first try. If this happens to you, USCIS gives you **one more opportunity within 60-90 days** of your initial interview. This second chance is included in your original N-400 application fee—no additional payment required.

## What Actually Happens During the Interview

When you arrive for your citizenship interview, the USCIS officer will test you on two components: **civics (U.S. history and government) and English** (reading, writing, and speaking). You need to pass both to succeed.

**The civics test requirements:**
- 2008 test: Answer 6 out of 10 questions correctly
- 2025 test: Answer 12 out of 20 questions correctly
- Questions are randomly selected from the official list

**The English test has three parts:**
- Speaking: Demonstrated during your interview conversation
- Reading: Read 1 out of 3 sentences correctly
- Writing: Write 1 out of 3 sentences correctly
