  - Location: `.env.local` (gitignored, not committed)
  - Usage: `app/api/representatives/route.js`
  - Fallback: Shows friendly message if unavailable
  - **Not needed for Vercel deployment to work**

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate (Today):**
1. Deploy to Vercel via dashboard
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Sign up with GitHub
   - Import `citizenship-test` repo
   - Click "Deploy"
   - See: `VERCEL_DASHBOARD_STEPS.md`

2. Test deployed app
   - Desktop browser testing
   - Mobile testing (iOS/Android)
   - Try "Add to Home Screen"

**This Week:**
- Share with friends for feedback
- Consider domain purchase (~$12/year)
- Apply for Google AdSense

**Later:**
- Add PWA support
- Build iOS native app
- Integrate ads

---

## Known Issues

**None** - Build passes, all features working, ready for production.

## Important for Next AI Session

### If Switching to Gemini Code Assist or GitHub Copilot:

**Tell the new AI:**
```
Please read these files for full context:
1. CLAUDE.md - Complete project overview
2. SESSION_SUMMARY.md - Current session state (this file)
3. AI_CONTEXT_HANDOFF.md - Guide for context switching

Latest commit: 400ab27
Current task: Ready to deploy to Vercel
```

### Key Context:
- Originally designed with $14.99 premium paywall
- This session: Removed ALL paywall code
- Changed to 100% free ad-based model
- Currently at deployment stage
- No ads implemented yet (future session)

---

## Decision Log

**Why Remove Paywall:**
- User decision: Prioritize user acquisition over immediate revenue
- Target audience (immigrants) is budget-conscious
- Free alternatives exist
- Ads can cover costs with fewer users needed

**Why Vercel:**
- Free tier handles 100k+ users
- Auto-deployment on Git push
- Free SSL + global CDN
- Next.js optimized

**Why Ad-Based Revenue:**
- Lower barrier to entry
- Break-even at 1k-2k users (vs 10k+ for premium)
- Non-intrusive placement
- Future upgrade option possible ($2.99 to remove ads)

## Previous Session Work (For Reference)

### Previous Session Summary - Automated Testing Infrastructure

**Previous Focus**: Creating automated test suite
**Previous Commit**: 5b2591f

### 1. Comprehensive Automated Test Suite
Created a complete Playwright-based testing infrastructure covering all manually identified bugs and user flows.

**Test Statistics**:
- 7 test files
- 57 test cases total
- Tests both desktop (Chromium) and mobile (iPhone 13)
- 100% coverage of manually identified bugs

**Test Files Created**:
1. `tests/01-answer-capitalization.spec.js` (6 tests) - Data validation
2. `tests/02-wrong-answers-generation.spec.js` (8 tests) - Logic validation
3. `tests/03-scroll-functionality.spec.js` (5 tests) - Mobile UX
4. `tests/04-navigation-flows.spec.js` (10 tests) - E2E navigation
5. `tests/05-paywall-enforcement.spec.js` (8 tests) - Business logic
6. `tests/06-category-selection.spec.js` (10 tests) - Filter logic
7. `tests/07-results-screen.spec.js` (10 tests) - UI/UX validation

### 2. Bug Fixes Identified and Resolved

**Data Quality Issues Found by Tests**:
- Fixed corrupted words from capitalization script:
  - "oU.S.de" ‚Üí "outside"
  - "ReligioU.S." ‚Üí "Religious"
  - "LoU.S.ana" ‚Üí "Louisiana"
  - "RU.S.a" ‚Üí "Russia"
  - "HU.S.n" ‚Üí "Hudson"
  - "ColumbU.S." ‚Üí "Columbus"
  - "U.S.." ‚Üí "U.S."

**Test Improvements**:
- Updated capitalization tests to handle edge cases:
  - Answers starting with numbers (e.g., "2" for "How many senators")
  - Answers starting with quotes (e.g., "Father of Our Country")
  - Answers with optional words in parentheses (allow lowercase)

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline

**GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`):
- Runs automatically on every push to main
- Runs on all pull requests
- Executes full test suite (build + lint + tests)
- Uploads test reports and traces
- Provides green checkmark or red X on GitHub

**Benefits**:
- Catch bugs before they reach production
- Automated quality gate
- Test reports stored for 30 days
- No manual testing required for regressions

### 4. Documentation

**Comprehensive Documentation Created**:
- `TESTING.md` (300+ lines) - Full testing documentation
  - How to run tests
  - Test architecture
  - Debugging guide
  - CI/CD integration
  - Best practices

- `TEST_SUMMARY.md` - High-level overview
  - Test categories explained
  - Bug regression coverage
  - Metrics and benefits
  - Future enhancements

- `tests/README.md` - Quick reference
  - Test file descriptions
  - Running tests
  - Bug coverage matrix

### 5. NPM Scripts

Added convenient test commands to `package.json`:
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:ui       # Interactive UI mode (best for learning)
npm run test:debug    # Debug mode
npm run test:report   # View HTML report
npm run test:headed   # Run with visible browser
```

## Technical Details

### Test Architecture

**Three Levels of Testing**:

1. **Data Validation Tests** (No browser required)
   - Fast execution (15 seconds)
   - Validates JSON data quality
   - Checks capitalization and formatting

2. **Unit/Logic Tests** (No browser required)
   - Fast execution (20 seconds)
   - Tests answerGenerator.js functions
   - Validates business logic

3. **End-to-End Tests** (Browser required)
   - Slower execution (3-5 minutes)
   - Tests complete user flows
   - Validates UI interactions

### Key Technologies

- **Playwright**: Browser automation framework
- **Node.js**: Test execution environment
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation
- **Chromium & iPhone 13**: Test targets

### Test Patterns Used

1. **Data-Driven Tests**: Loop through JSON and validate
2. **Unit Tests**: Test functions directly
3. **E2E Tests**: Simulate real user journeys
4. **Mobile Tests**: iPhone viewport testing
5. **Regression Tests**: Prevent old bugs from returning

---

## Session Workflow

### 1. Initial Request
User asked to create automated tests based on chat history of manual testing sessions.

### 2. Test Analysis
Analyzed chat history and identified 10 categories of test cases:
- Answer capitalization
- Wrong answer generation
- Scroll functionality (mobile)
- Navigation flows
- Paywall enforcement
- Category selection
- Results screen display
- Personalized question isolation

### 3. Test Suite Creation
Created 7 comprehensive test files covering 57 test cases.

### 4. Test Execution
Ran tests and discovered real data quality issues:
- Corrupted words from previous capitalization script
- Edge cases in answer formatting

### 5. Bug Fixes
Fixed all data issues identified by tests:
- Corrected corrupted words
- Updated test assertions to handle edge cases

### 6. Documentation
Created comprehensive documentation for:
- How to use the test suite
- Understanding testing concepts for new developers
- CI/CD pipeline explanation

### 7. Commit & Summary
Committed all changes with detailed commit message and updated session summary.
