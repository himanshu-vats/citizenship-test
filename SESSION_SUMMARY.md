## What Was Built

### 1. Study Mode - Quizlet-Style Flashcards ‚úÖ
**File:** `app/study/page.js`

A complete flashcard learning system inspired by Quizlet:
- Click-to-flip cards showing question on front, answer(s) on back
- Two-button system: "Still Learning" (orange) vs "Know" (green)
- Progress counters at top: Still Learning count, Know count, Unstudied count
- Mobile swipe gestures: left = Still Learning, right = Know
- Keyboard shortcuts: ‚Üê Still Learning, ‚Üí Know, Spacebar = flip
- Category filtering (all categories from questions)
- Version toggle (2008/2025)
- "Show only unstudied cards" checkbox filter
- Reset progress button
- Status badges on cards
- Smooth animations and visual feedback
- localStorage persistence

**Access:** Linked from home page with prominent purple gradient button

### 2. Professional Results Screen ‚úÖ
**File:** `components/ResultsScreen.jsx`

Replaced the unprofessional `alert()` popup with a full-featured results component:
- Full-screen overlay with gradient header (green for pass, gray for fail)
- Large score display (e.g., 17/20, 85%)
- Pass/Fail badge with celebration emoji
- Action buttons:
  - **Review All Answers** - Expandable section with all Q&A
  - **Take Another Test** - Restarts from version selection
  - **Study Mode** - Direct link to flashcards
  - **Share Results** - Native share API with clipboard fallback
  - **Back to Home** - Returns to main screen
- Detailed review shows:
  - All questions with ‚úì/‚úó indicators
  - User's answer vs correct answer
  - Full explanations from answerGenerator
- "Study Questions You Missed" button
- Performance tips based on score
- Mobile-responsive design

**Integration:** Modified `app/page.js` to add `showResults` and `testResults` state

testVersion: '2025'                       // Currently selected version in study mode
```
