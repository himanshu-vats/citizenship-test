# Netlify OAuth Setup Guide (5 Minutes)

Follow these steps exactly to get your blog CMS working.

---

## Step 1: Update GitHub OAuth App (1 minute)

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/developers
2. Click on your **"CivicsPass CMS"** OAuth app (or create new if deleted)
3. Set these values:
   ```
   Application name: CivicsPass CMS
   Homepage URL: https://civicspass.com
   Authorization callback URL: https://api.netlify.com/auth/done
   ```
4. Click **"Update application"**
5. **Copy your Client ID** (you'll need it)
6. **Generate a new client secret** and **copy it** (save somewhere safe!)

---

## Step 2: Create Netlify Site (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/signup
2. Sign up (or log in if you have account)
3. Click **"Add new site"** â†’ **"Import an existing project"**
4. Choose **"Deploy with GitHub"**
5. Authorize Netlify to access your repos
6. Select **"himanshu-vats/citizenship-test"**
7. Build settings:
   - Build command: *(leave empty)*
   - Publish directory: *(leave empty)*
8. Click **"Deploy citizenship-test"**
9. Wait 1-2 minutes for deploy (you won't use this deployment, just need the site)

---

## Step 3: Add Environment Variables to Netlify (1 minute)

1. In your Netlify site dashboard, go to **"Site configuration"** â†’ **"Environment variables"**
2. Click **"Add a variable"** â†’ **"Add a single variable"**
3. Add first variable:
   - **Key**: `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
   - **Value**: [paste your GitHub OAuth Client ID]
   - Scopes: Keep all selected
   - Click **"Create variable"**
4. Add second variable:
   - **Key**: `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - **Value**: [paste your GitHub OAuth Client Secret]
   - Scopes: Keep all selected
   - Click **"Create variable"**

---

## Step 4: Redeploy Netlify (30 seconds)

This ensures the env vars are loaded:

1. Go to **"Deploys"** tab
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"** â†’ **"Deploy site"**
3. Wait 30 seconds for deploy to finish

---

## Step 5: Test Your CMS! (1 minute)

1. Wait 2-3 minutes for **Vercel** to rebuild (check https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Visit: **https://civicspass.com/admin**
3. Click **"Login with GitHub"**
4. **Authorize the app**
5. **You should see your blog articles!** âœ…

## How It Works

```
Your Site (Vercel)
    â†“
Click "Login"
    â†“
Netlify OAuth Proxy
    â†“
GitHub Authorization
    â†“
Back to Netlify (exchanges code for token)
    â†“
Back to Your CMS (Vercel)
    â†“
âœ… Logged in!
```

**Important:**
- Your site ONLY runs on Vercel
- Netlify is ONLY used for OAuth handling (like a tiny microservice)
- You never visit the Netlify deployment
- Zero cost for both services

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Login with GitHub" button doesn't appear
- Clear browser cache
- Try incognito window
- Check that Vercel has finished deploying

### Login fails / redirects to wrong place
- Verify GitHub OAuth callback is exactly: `https://api.netlify.com/auth/done`
- Check environment variables are set in **Netlify** (not Vercel)
- Make sure you redeployed Netlify after adding env vars

### "Error loading config"
- Check that `/public/admin/config.yml` exists
- Verify the file is committed to GitHub
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Still not working?
1. Check Netlify deploy logs for errors
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify GitHub OAuth app shows your Client ID matches what's in Netlify

## That's It!

Once this is working, you can:
- Write articles at `civicspass.com/admin`
- Edit existing articles
- Upload images
- Articles auto-publish when you save

No more command line or VS Code needed! ðŸŽ‰
