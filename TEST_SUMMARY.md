| 3 | State data (governor/capital) in wrong questions | 02 | Personalized data not in non-personalized questions |
| 4 | Review All Answers not scrollable (iPhone) | 03 | Review section scrollable on mobile |
| 5 | Explanation scroll issue (iPhone) | 03 | Explanation text scrollable during test |
| 6 | `&apos;` display issue on results | 07 | No apostrophe display issues |
| 7 | "Maybe Later" button should go home | 04 | Maybe Later redirects to home |
| 8 | Stats page tests not clickable | 04 | Test history items clickable |
| 9 | Category selection test size issue | 06 | Test size auto-adjusts |
| 10 | Paywall bypass possible | 05 | Cannot bypass paywall |

## Test Execution

### Local Development

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Interactive mode (best for development)
npm run test:ui

# Debug mode
npm run test:debug

# View report
npm run test:report
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`):
- ✓ Runs on every push to main
- ✓ Runs on every pull request
- ✓ Tests on Ubuntu (Chromium + Mobile)
- ✓ Uploads test reports
- ✓ Uploads traces on failure

---

## Test Patterns Used

### 1. Data-Driven Tests
Tests that validate JSON data without browser:
```javascript
questions2025.forEach((question) => {
  expect(question.answers[0]).toMatch(/[A-Z]/);
});
```

### 2. Unit Tests
Tests that validate library functions:
```javascript
const result = prepareQuestionForTest(question, '2025', mockUserInfo);
expect(result.displayOptions).not.toContain('Bob Ferguson');
```

### 3. E2E Tests
Tests that simulate complete user flows:
```javascript
await page.click('text=Start Practice Test');
await page.click('text=2025 Test');
await page.click('text=Skip for Now');
await page.click('text=Begin Test');
```

### 4. Mobile Tests
Tests with mobile viewport:
```javascript
test.use({ viewport: { width: 390, height: 844 } });
```

## Benefits of This Test Suite

### 1. Regression Prevention
Every bug that was manually found is now automatically tested. If a developer accidentally reintroduces one of these bugs, the test suite will catch it immediately.

### 2. Faster Development
Developers can make changes with confidence, knowing the test suite will catch breaking changes.

### 3. Documentation
Tests serve as living documentation of expected behavior and edge cases.

### 4. Quality Gate
CI/CD pipeline prevents broken code from being deployed to production.

### 5. Mobile Coverage
Mobile-specific tests ensure good experience on iPhone and other mobile devices.

## Test Maintenance

### When to Update Tests

1. **UI Changes**: Update selectors when button text/structure changes
2. **New Features**: Add new test files for new functionality
3. **Bug Fixes**: Add regression tests for each new bug found
4. **Data Changes**: Re-run validation when question banks update

### Test Health Indicators

✅ **Healthy Test Suite**:
- All tests pass consistently
- Tests run in under 5 minutes
- No flaky tests
- Clear test names
- Independent tests

⚠️ **Needs Attention**:
- Tests fail intermittently
- Long execution time (>10 min)
- Hard to understand failures
- Tests depend on each other

---

## Future Enhancements
