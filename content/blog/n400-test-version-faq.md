## Introduction

The transition to the new 2025 Civics Test is one of the most confusing topics for N-400 applicants today. We've gathered the most common questions from immigration forums and provided clear, direct answers to help you navigate this change.

---

### **1. Which citizenship test will I take?**

This is the most important question, and the answer is simple: it depends on your **N-400 filing date**.

- **Filed before October 20, 2025?** You will take the **2008 Civics Test**.
- **Filed on or after October 20, 2025?** You will take the **2025 Civics Test**.

Your interview date does not matter.

### **2. Is the 2025 test harder than the 2008 test?**

It is more comprehensive. Here's why it may be considered more challenging:
- **More Questions to Study:** 128 questions vs. 100.
- **More Questions on the Test:** The officer asks 20 questions vs. 10.
- **Different Question Style:** The 2025 test uses scenarios and images, requiring understanding rather than just memorization.

However, the passing score remains 60% for both versions.

### **3. Should I rush to file my N-400 before the October 20, 2025 deadline?**

**Maybe, but be careful.** While filing before the deadline locks you into the 2008 test, rushing can lead to serious mistakes on your application. An error on your N-400 could lead to a Request for Evidence (RFE), long delays, or even a denial. The $725 application fee is non-refundable.

**Our advice:** Prioritize accuracy over speed. It is better to take more time to prepare for the 2025 test than to get your application denied due to a rushed mistake.

---

### **4. What are the main differences in format?**

- **2008 Test:** 100 questions to study. Officer asks up to 10. Test stops when you get 6 correct.
- **2025 Test:** 128 questions to study. Officer asks all 20. You need 12 correct to pass.

---

### **5. If I fail the test, which version do I retake?**

You will retake the same version you took the first time. If you filed before the deadline and failed the 2008 test, your second attempt will also be the 2008 test, even if the re-test date is well into 2026.

---
