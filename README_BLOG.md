## 🎯 Key Concepts

### You DON'T Need:
❌ To write any code
❌ To use the terminal
❌ To install anything on your computer
❌ A separate CMS or admin panel
❌ Netlify (that was my mistake - ignore it!)

### You DO Need:
✅ GitHub account (you already have this)
✅ Vercel account (you already have this)
✅ Web browser
✅ Ability to write markdown (it's just text with simple formatting)

## 🔑 The Magic

When you save a file on GitHub, Vercel automatically:
1. Detects the change
2. Rebuilds your entire site
3. Deploys the new version
4. Makes your article live

**You don't have to do anything except save the file!**

### Scenario: You want to write about the new citizenship test

**1. Think of a topic:**
"What's New in the 2025 Citizenship Test"

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Writing Tips:

- **Use subheadings** - Helps readers scan
- **Keep paragraphs short** - 2-3 sentences max

- **Add a CTA** - "Start practicing today" with link

### SEO Tips:
- **Keyword in title** - e.g., "US Citizenship Test 2025"
- **Meta description** - Write compelling 150-char summary
- **Use headings** - H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections
- **Internal linking** - Link to other articles and app pages

### Consistency Tips:
- Use the **same categories** as existing articles
- Keep **readTime** accurate (300 words ≈ 1 minute)
- Always include **disclaimer** at bottom

## 🆘 Common Questions

**Q: Can I schedule articles for future publication?**
A: Yes! Set the `date` field to a future date. The article publishes immediately but will be sorted by that date.

**Q: Can I delete an article?**
A: Yes! Go to the file on GitHub, click the trash icon, commit the deletion. Vercel will rebuild without it.

**Q: Can I have draft articles?**
A: Yes! Just don't commit them to GitHub yet. Keep them on your computer or in a private repo.

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
A: No! You just need to know basic markdown (headings, lists, bold/italic). See the cheat sheet in `HOW_TO_PUBLISH_BLOG.md`.

**Q: What if I make a typo after publishing?**
A: No problem! Just edit the file on GitHub and commit. It'll redeploy with the fix in 2-3 minutes.

**Q: Can I add images?**
A: Yes! Upload images to `public/images/blog/` and reference them: `![Alt text](/images/blog/image.png)`
