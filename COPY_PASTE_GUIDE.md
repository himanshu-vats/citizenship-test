## üé® Sample Output Preview

When you paste the markdown, Sanity converts it to beautiful rich text:

### Before (Markdown):
```
## What Actually Happens During the Interview

When you arrive for your citizenship interview, the USCIS officer will test you on two components: **civics (U.S. history and government) and English** (reading, writing, and speaking). You need to pass both to succeed.

**The civics test requirements:**
- 2008 test: Answer 6 out of 10 questions correctly
- 2025 test: Answer 12 out of 20 questions correctly
```

### After (Rendered on Site):
![Beautiful formatted article with proper headings, bold text, and styled lists]

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Problem: Bold/Italic not showing
**Solution:** Make sure you used proper markdown syntax:
- `**text**` for bold (NOT `__text__`)
- `*text*` for italic (NOT `_text_`)

### Problem: Links not clickable
**Solution:** Use this exact format: `[text](https://url.com)`
- Include `https://` in the URL
- No spaces between `]` and `(`

### Problem: Headings not formatting
**Solution:**
- Use `##` for H2 (with space after: `## Title`)
- Use `###` for H3 (with space after: `### Title`)
- Don't use `#` (H1) except for the main title

### Problem: Lists not formatting
**Solution:**
- Use `-` or `*` for bullets (with space after: `- Item`)
- Use `1.` for numbers (with space after: `1. Item`)
- Add blank line before and after the list
