   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Your app is now live at: `your-project.vercel.app`

**Option B: Using Vercel CLI**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login

# Deploy from project directory
vercel

# Follow prompts:

```

**Deployment URL:** You'll get a free URL like `citizenship-test.vercel.app`

---

### Step 2: Connect Custom Domain (Optional but Recommended)

   - Enter your domain: `uscitizenship.app`
   - Vercel gives you DNS records to add

3. **Configure DNS:**

     ```
     Type: A
     Name: @
     Value: 76.76.21.21

     Type: CNAME
     Name: www
     Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
     ```

4. **Wait 5-60 minutes** for DNS propagation
5. SSL certificate is auto-issued by Vercel (free HTTPS!)

---

### Step 3: Set up Google AdSense (Web Ads)

**3.1: Create AdSense Account**

1. Go to https://www.google.com/adsense/
2. Click "Get Started"
3. Fill in your website URL (your Vercel URL or custom domain)
4. Enter payment details (you'll get paid when you hit $100)
5. Wait for approval (1-7 days)

     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

**3.3: Integration Options**

I'll create two integration points for you:

1. **Bottom banner ad** (non-intrusive, always visible)
2. **Interstitial ad** (between test questions - optional)

Would you like me to implement the AdSense integration now? I'll create:
- An AdSense component
- Strategic ad placements
- Mobile-responsive ad units

---

## Phase 2: PWA Setup (Make Web App Installable on iOS)

This makes your web app installable like a native app on iOS home screens.

### Files I'll Create for You:

1. **`/public/manifest.json`** - App metadata
2. **iOS icons** - Various sizes (120x120, 152x152, 167x167, 180x180)
3. **Meta tags** in `app/layout.js`
4. **Service worker** (optional, for offline support)

### What Users Will See:

- "Add to Home Screen" prompt on iOS Safari
- App icon on home screen
- Full-screen app experience (no browser bars)
- Splash screen when launching

**Cost:** $0 (uses your existing web app)

**Time to implement:** 1-2 hours

Would you like me to add PWA support now?

---

## Phase 3: Native iOS App (App Store)

### Prerequisites:

1. **Apple Developer Account** ($99/year)
   - Enroll at: https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/
   - Approval takes 1-2 days

2. **Mac Computer** (required for building iOS apps)
   - OR use a CI/CD service like Codemagic ($0 for open-source)

### Step 1: Install Capacitor

Capacitor wraps your web app in a native iOS container.

```bash
# Install Capacitor
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npm install @capacitor/ios

# Initialize Capacitor
npx cap init

# Prompts:
# App name? US Citizenship Test
# App ID? com.yourname.citizenship (reverse domain format)
# Directory? (press Enter)

# Add iOS platform
npx cap add ios
```

### Step 2: Configure iOS Project

```bash
# Open Xcode
npx cap open ios
```

In Xcode:
1. **Team:** Select your Apple Developer account
2. **Bundle Identifier:** `com.yourname.citizenship`
3. **Display Name:** US Citizenship Test
4. **Version:** 1.0
5. **Build Number:** 1

### Step 3: Add App Icons

You'll need icons in these sizes:
- 20x20, 29x29, 40x40, 58x58, 60x60, 76x76, 80x80, 87x87, 120x120, 152x152, 167x167, 180x180, 1024x1024

**Tool to generate icons:** https://www.appicon.co (upload 1024x1024, download all sizes)

### Step 4: Integrate Google AdMob (iOS Ads)

**4.1: Create AdMob Account**

1. Go to https://admob.google.com/
2. Sign in with Google account
3. Click "Get Started"
4. Add your app:
   - Platform: iOS
   - App name: US Citizenship Test
   - Is your app published? No (select this for now)

**4.2: Create Ad Units**

You'll create:
1. **Banner Ad** (bottom of screen, 320x50)
2. **Interstitial Ad** (full-screen between questions - optional)

AdMob gives you an App ID and Ad Unit IDs:
```
App ID: ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~XXXXXXXXXX
Banner Ad Unit ID: ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX
Interstitial Ad Unit ID: ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX
```

**4.3: Install AdMob Plugin**

```bash
npm install @capacitor-community/admob
npx cap sync
```

I'll create an AdMob service for you that handles:
- Banner ads at bottom of screens
- Interstitial ads between tests (configurable frequency)
- GDPR consent (required for EU users)

### Step 5: Build & Test

```bash
# Sync web code to iOS
npm run build
npx cap sync ios

# Open in Xcode
npx cap open ios

# In Xcode:
# 1. Select a simulator (iPhone 15 Pro)
# 2. Click Play button to run
# 3. Test the app!
```

## Phase 4: Ad Revenue Optimization

### Ad Placement Strategy

**Web (AdSense):**
1. **Bottom sticky banner** - Always visible, doesn't interfere with content
2. **Between test results and next action** - Natural break point
3. **Avoid:** Ads during active test taking (frustrates users)

**iOS (AdMob):**
1. **Bottom banner** - Always visible
2. **Interstitial after every 3rd test** - Not too aggressive
3. **Reward video** (future): "Watch ad to unlock explanations" (optional)

### Expected Revenue (Realistic Estimates)

**Assumptions:**
- eCPM (earnings per 1000 impressions): $1-3 for education apps
- Average user sessions: 5-10 (studying for 2 weeks)

**Monthly Revenue Projection:**

| Users/Month | Impressions | Revenue (Low) | Revenue (High) |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| 100         | 500         | $0.50         | $1.50          |
| 1,000       | 5,000       | $5            | $15            |
| 10,000      | 50,000      | $50           | $150           |
| 100,000     | 500,000     | $500          | $1,500         |

**To reach $100/month (AdSense minimum payout):**
- Need ~5,000-10,000 users/month
- Achievable with good SEO and word-of-mouth

## Phase 5: Marketing & Growth (After Launch)

### SEO Optimization

1. **Title Tag:** "Free US Citizenship Test 2025 | Practice Civics Questions"
2. **Meta Description:** Include in `app/layout.js`
3. **Submit to Google Search Console**
4. **Create sitemap.xml**

### Social Media

1. **Reddit:** Post in r/immigration, r/USCIS (be helpful, not spammy)
2. **Facebook Groups:** Immigration support groups
3. **YouTube:** Create study videos, link to your app

### App Store Optimization (ASO)

1. **Keywords:** Research competitor keywords
2. **Screenshots:** Show best features first
3. **Ratings:** Ask users to rate (after they pass!)
4. **Updates:** Regular updates improve ranking
