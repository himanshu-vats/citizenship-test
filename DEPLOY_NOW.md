## Important: Environment Variables (Optional)

If you want ZIP code personalization to show congressional representatives:

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to your project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add:
   - Key: `GOOGLE_CIVIC_API_KEY`
   - Value: (paste your API key from `.env.local`)
   - Environment: Production, Preview, Development (check all)
3. Click "Save"
4. Redeploy: Deployments ‚Üí Click "..." ‚Üí "Redeploy"

**Note:** App works fine WITHOUT this key. Only affects representative names in personalized questions.

   - Try starting a test
   - Toggle dark mode
   - Check study mode

3. **Test on Mobile:**

## Your Live URLs

After deployment, you get:

**Production URL:**
```
https://citizenship-test.vercel.app
```
‚òùÔ∏è This is your permanent URL - share this one!

**Preview URLs:**
```
https://citizenship-test-abc123.vercel.app
```
‚òùÔ∏è Generated for each deployment - good for testing

## Auto-Deployment (If Using GitHub)

Every time you push code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Made improvements"
git push origin main
```

Vercel **automatically**:
- ‚úÖ Detects the push
- ‚úÖ Builds your app
- ‚úÖ Deploys to production
- ‚úÖ Sends you email notification

**No manual redeployment needed!**

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Failed?

1. **Check build locally first:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   If this fails, fix errors before deploying

2. **View Vercel logs:**
   - Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Deployments
   - Click failed deployment ‚Üí "View Logs"
   - Look for error message

3. **Common fixes:**
   - Make sure all files are committed to Git
   - Check that `package.json` has all dependencies
   - Verify `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` (it is)

### Site is Slow?

- Vercel has global CDN - should be fast worldwide
- First load might be slower (cold start)
- Subsequent loads are instant

### Can't Find Deployment?

- Check Vercel dashboard under "Projects"
- Email from Vercel has deployment link
- Run `vercel ls` in terminal to see deployments
